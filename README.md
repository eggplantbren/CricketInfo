CricketInfo
===========

Some InfoNest stuff to measure entropies in cricket.
This depends on [InfoNest](https://github.com/eggplantbren/InfoNest),
which I've included as a submodule in this repository. Make sure you use
`--recursive` when you clone this repository:

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/eggplantbren/CricketInfo
